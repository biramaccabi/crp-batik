Shutterfly Batik 1.7 modifications for the Common Rendering Platform. 
--------------------------------------------

We are making an effort to flag all the CRP changes to batik, primarily so that we can easily distinguish
CRP-based logic from original Batik logic. (Else things can get quite confusing while reading the code.)


Conventions for CRP-based modifications:
--------------------------------------------

Please use the following annotations when modifying original Batik code.


- To flag one or two lines of code that have CRP mods. 
// CRP: <comment> 

- To add a comment the original batik code:
// CRP comment: <comment>

- To flag a larger block of code that has CRP mods.
// Begin CRP: <comment>
    <code added for CRP>
// End CRP


- To flag a CRP TODO. 
// CRP TODO: <comment>


- To flag a class added for CRP.
/**
 * CRP: class added. 
 *
 * <class description>
 */
